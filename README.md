SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: [Italo Pennella]

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[https://www.w3schools.com/Js/,https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout, https://stackoverflow.com/, https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html ]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[When I was designing this submission I had to map out specific character keys in a specific order for the win/lose ending music. Mapping out the frequencies for piano notes didn't pose much of an issue until I got to the lower ones for the bass clef. It turns out that frequencies under 200Hz cannot be heard well so I had to cut that part of the song out. After cutting it out I decided to test the two melodies of the song together and to my surprise, I wasn't able to do so. The program had problems playing more than one note together making it very clunk sounding as other sounds cut off others before they finished. In order to combat this, I append the melodies together in order to overcome the issue and produce the results I was looking for. Mapping out the keys took me a good chunk of hours and meticulous planning of rest notes in order to properly pace the song(Megalovania-Undertale; if you get a chance check out the project to hear it!). On top of all this, I sprained my index finger on my dominant hand earlier in the week and had to use my middle finger as a substitute until it felt better again. Using my middle finger actually wasn't too bad of an experience and it allowed me to properly recover my other finger. Overall using HTML again was a very fun experience that allowed me to explore creative freedoms that a basic classroom assignment would have prevented otherwise and has inspired me to start working on my own website.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Some questions I have aren't too specific to this front-end coding, but more of how the back-end web architecture would look like compared to this. I know that glitch.com hosts the webpage for the memory game, but I feel like knowing more about the network side would be helpful especially for my concentration in cybersecurity. If I had to come up with a question for the front-end coding though I would ask how device info request are made silently when visiting the webpage with javascript. Knowing more about this might be useful in understanding how sites like grabify can pull information about the IP address and device model of a user. I think also learning about how to make cookie sessions in order to save progress on something like a game might work when it comes to a webpage.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had more time to work on this I would probably change the formatting of the website from more of a musical meme webpage to something a little more challenging and engaging for users. Maybe incorporating a prize after winning levels of the game as it gets progressively harder. Each round would award part of a base64 key which could be decrypted and used to access a link to the hall of fame webpage where they can insert their name for recognition. Something like this would be what I would have in mind for my prework if I had less school work and more time to pour into HTML and Javascript. Maybe I should try it later in the year just for the fun of it.]
